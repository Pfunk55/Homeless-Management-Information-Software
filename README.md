# Free Homeless-Management-Information-Software
These are simple Excel VBA programs designed for low barrier homeless shelter client check-in and registration. Client_check-in is used by volunteers to check in clients as they arrive at the shelter. Client_database is for the master list of clients that may be used to generate a donor report. These programs were written for a shelter that does not receive HUD funds and so do not meet 2020 HMIS data standards set by HUD. 

They are written to be used by volunteers and to require minimal user computer sophistication. Client check-in is done first on a paper form, and then the data on paper forms was entered episodically during slow periods, and perhaps by multiple people. Those doing data entry need protections to ensure that the same data is not entered multiple times. Accordingly, the full database is visible behind the form, and the program checks and flags duplicates.

To prevent those doing data entry from overwriting the data by accident, both Excel sheets are password protected. The password is currently set in the code to "mypassword" as a default. Use "Replace" to change this to the password you prefer.
